# Stratagem Hero
The Helldivers 2 mini-game Stratagem Hero, written in Go using Raylib

## Controls
* Escape: quit
* Arrow Keys: you're a Helldiver, you know what to do



## Installation
You can either grab the latest version from the releases(only for Windows and Mac) or you can build from source
### Releases
On the right there should be a "releases", and it should have the latest release right there
### Building from source
First of all, download [Go](https://go.dev) if you don't have it<br>
Then, either download or clone this repo<br>
Finally, navigate to this repo's folder in your terminal, and enter `go run .`, and it should work


## Issues
My code is pretty bad so just make an issue if you find any bugs



## Credits
Stratagem Hero and Helldivers 2 belongs to Arrowhead Game Studios and Sony Interactive Entertainment, and are, therefore, you know, NOT MINE
